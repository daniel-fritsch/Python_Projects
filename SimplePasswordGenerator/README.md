Simple Python Password Generator

This is a simple programming which can generate a detailed password of desired length and composition using a few user inputs.

special characters, and numbers. The user can choose if any of these should be included or not depending on the password they require.

Please enter yes or no for the following options
Do you want uppercase letters in your password: yes
Do you want lowercase letters in your password: yes

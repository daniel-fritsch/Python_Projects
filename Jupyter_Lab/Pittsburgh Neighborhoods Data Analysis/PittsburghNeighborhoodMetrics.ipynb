    "For our overarching metric we chose to analyze was security in the city of Pittsburgh. The submetrics were as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "Daniel Fritsch: Fire Incidents\n",
    "\n",
    "Sahil Mishra: Police Incidents (last 30 days)\n",
    "\n",
    "Harris Roberts: Arrest Data\n",
    "\n",
    "We chose these categories because we believe them to be good indicators of neighborhood security and safety and provide a good basis to produce an assumption based on which neighborhood is best. We will determine which neighborhood ends up being the best based on our metrics by using a system of scoring each neighborhood on a scale of 1-10 and then using this analysis across the respective categories to determine an overall winner. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How do these concepts relate to safety. Fire incidents are curcial to public safety because a fire in a neighborhood would obviously threaten the safety of many of the citizens in that neighborhood. Building fires or even tree fires or car fires could threaten to cause a wider burn which would be very harmful for a large portion of the population. Because of this it is important to consider fire incidents an aspect of safety. Arrest Data is another factor we can consider when analyzing the safety of a neighborhood because it is a good indication of the safety of the civilians in that area. The fewer arrests that occur in a neighborhood the less the crime rate is likely to be which is of course ideal when analyzing for the safety of a certain place. Lastly, police incidents helps us corroborate data with arrest data to get a better picture of the crime safety in that neighborhood. Some areas might have higher arrest data due to discrimination or other factors and so police incidents may be a better way to analyze this metric becasue it might take out whatever bias there oculd be in arrest data. By doing this we could determine a better overall picture of security in Pittsburgh and which neighborhood would be best for someone choosing the safest area. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "How we are choosing the best neighborhood:\n",
    "\n",
    "We have chosen to analyze the best neighborhood on a basis of a 1-10 score for each section. For each category each member will use their data to assign a rating to neighborhoods based on which ones appear best in their respective analysis. For example, if a specific neighborhood appears at the top of one members ranking than it would receive a score of 10 and if it is one of the worst it would get a score of 1. In this way we can then add the total scores for the neighborhoods in order to see which one would be the best. "

    "This portion of the project was the section on fire incidents in Pittsburgh. It trackes the number of fires of a variety of types in the different neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. For example: there is a notation in the data that a fire is a building fire or a vehicle fire. In both cases we decided the threat would be pretty high as it can impact surrounding areas and has the potential to spread and become much more harmful. Because of this I considered the total number of fires in each neighborhood in order to figure out which one was the safest, those that are safest being the ones with the fewest fires of any kind. I found a data set which had a very intuitive system of tracking fire related occurences in different neighborhoods of the city. Naturally, the areas that have the least amount of fires would be the ones that are considered \"best\" from a habitability and safety perspective so the ones with the least fires will receive the highest ratings in my portion of the project.\n"

    "Now that we have a good idea of which neighborhoods have the lowest rates of fires in them we need to enumerate this in the 1-10 scale that we use to decided which neighborhood is the best overall. For fire incidents we considered any neighborhood which has less than 15 incidents to receive a 10 rating. Any neighborhood with between 30 and 15 incidents will receive a score of 9. Any between 50 and 30 receives an 8. Between 75 and 50 receives a 7. Between 100 and 75 receives a 6. The system continues by intervals of 25 from this point but these would not need to be considered as they are too bad in the rating to be considered for the overall safest neighborhood. It is likely that only the best neighborhood receiving a score of 10 will have to be considered for the overall best with other metrics.\n",

    "My personal favorite neighborhood is Point Breeze as I grew up in that area and love its parks and peaceful streets. It has a lot of wonderful houses and is just a really nice neighborhood in general. In the data I analyzed their were a total of 119 fires recorded for this area. This indicates that as far as fire incidents are concerned Point Breeze is not the very safest option. It would receive a score of 5 according to my system. In comparison to the neighborhoods show in the chart above Point Breeze is a lot less safe as far as fire incidents are concerned. "

Oliver, Regent Square, and Mount Oliver Borough. The very best of this metric are Ridgemont, East Carnegie, Mount Oliver, Regent Square, and Mount Oliver Borough. So these are the neighborhoods that will be considered first when writing the final conclusion for all the metrics combined as these are the very best from the fire incidents metric. All of the top 5 have had 12 or less fires incidents recorded in the data set, meaning they are incredibly safe for habitation from a fire perspective. "

The data lists the date of the incident, the time of day, where the incident happened, what incident actually occurred, and the offenses given among other things. After looking at the data, I chose to determine the best neighborhood based on how little police incidents occured in the last 30 days. I chose this metric because it works well with arrest data, which gives a better idea of the crime rate going on in each neighborhood. This also helps when considering our overall metric, which is the security of each neighborhood.\n",

    "Using the data from the graph, you can see that there are quite a few neighborhoods that have had little incidents occurr. So, for the sake of ranking the best neighborhoods, I've decided to give each neighborhood with 2 incidents a score of 9/10, those neighborhoods being Summer Hill, Mount Oliver, Fairywood, Esplen, Stanton Heights, Oakwood, and Arlington Heights, and each neighborhood with only 1 incident 10/10, those being Duquesne Heights, Glen Hazel, West End, Swissheim Park, and St. Clair.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion: The way the data determined the best neighborhood is different from my personal favorite neighborhood. Using the data and the metric of least incidents occurred in the neighborhood, the best neighborhoods are ones like St. Clair, West End, and a few others because they have only had one or two incidents in the past month. My personal favorite neighborhood is Shadyside because the area itself is a nice place to be, with it not being too busy like the city, but not being in the middle of nowhere either. However, according to the data, Shadyside has had over 40 incidents in the past month, making it a bad neighborhood compared to the others in the data. While the data determines that neighborhoods like West end and St. Clair are the best because of their low number of incidents, my own personal favorite neighborhood of Shadyside definitely contradicts what the data shows."

    "For this part of the project we chose to analyze arrest data to get a better idea of the crime rate for the different neighborhoods of Pittsburgh. This data will hopefully give us a better idea of the overall security of a specific neighborhood as a high crime rate would be highly undesirable for determining the best neighborhood. The data set I used for this was the ArrestData dataset from the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center. This dataset was very thorough and had plenty of specific information. However, because we are looking at the overall safety of the neighborhood, not the safety in regards to a specific crime, I want to look at the total number of listed arrests for a neighborhood. If a neighborhood has 200 crimes listed it will very likely be worse than one with 15 crimes listed. \n",

    "The process below details the analysis to determine which neighborhood is safest in this regard, those being the ones with the smalles amount of recroded arrests based on the data sets. "

    "Now we have a good visual of the very best neighborhoods in terms of having the lowest amount of arrests. In this graph we can see that Chartiers City, Swisshelm Park, St. Clair, Arlington Heights, Oakwood, Ridgemont, Regent Square, Central Northside, Mt.Oliver Boro, Troy Hill-Herrs Island, and Mt. Oliver Neighborhood have by far the lowest values. With this in mind we can create a 1-10 scoring system to evaluate the safety of the neighborhoods in this metric based on our knowledge of the data distribution. Here I have decided that all neighborhoods with a value less than 15 will receive a 10 rating on the scale as they clearly maintain the lowest amount of arrests among all the neighborhoods in the data set. Neighborhoods with between 50 and 15 will receive a score of 9. This may seem like a major jump but some neighborhoods record arrest data of more than 4000 so a neighborhood with 50 arrests is still doing very well safety wise. A neighborhood will receive an 8 if it has between 250 and 50 arrests, a 7 if it has between 1000 and 250 arrests, a 6 if it has between 1500 and 1000 arrests, a 5 if it has between 2000 and 1500 arests, a 4 if it has between 2500 and 2000 arrests, a 3 if it has between 3000 and 2500, a 2 if it has between 4000 and 3000. Anything with an arrest value above 4000 will receive a 1 based on this system of measurement.\n",
    "\n",
    "My personal favorite neighborhood is Oakland which falls in the middle of the data set. Though this data contradicts my personal assumptions it is understandable how an area with so many shops and students could result in a lot of arrests. Oakland would however receive a very poor score for safest neighborhood based on this metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conclusion for Metric 3: Based on the scoring system the neighborhoods that will receive an excellent score of 10 are St. Clair, Arlington Heights, Oakwood, Ridgemont, Regent Square, Central Northside, Mt.Oliver Boro, Troy Hill-Herrs Island, and Mt. Oliver Neighborhood in ascending order. I should note here that assuming Mt. Oliver Boro and Mt. Oliver neighborhood are the same thing and the data set should not distinguish between them, the combined values of the 2 would still be below the threshold of 30, ensuring that regardless Mt. Oliver has a score of 10. Chartiers and Swisshelm Park depicted above have values of 9 along with many others including Glen Hazel among others. Neighborhoods below a score of 9 will likely not need to be considered for the overall best neighborhood as it is highly likely that a nieghborhood would have at least a 9 in each category. Nonetheless other neighborhoods will be considered if a best can not be found based on these top values."

    "Based on the data collected over the significantly large data sets provided by the Western Pennsylvania Regional Data Center we have been able to determine the best neighborhoods in regards to specific metrics as discussed above, those being arrest data, police incidents in the last 30 days, and fire incidents. These 3 metrics belong to the overarching metric security/safety which is how we chose to evaluate the best Pittsburgh neighborhood.\n",

    "For fire incidents we concluded that the best neighborhoods, receiving a score of 10, were St. Clair, Arlington Heights, Oakwood, Ridgemont, East Carnegie, Mt. Oliver, Regent Square, and Mount Oliver Borough. The very best according to this metric are Ridgemont, East Carnegie, Mount Oliver, Regent Square, and Mount Oliver Borough. Among those neighborhoods receiving a score of 10(score for those neighborhoods with 15 or less incidents) these 5 will be considered first in relation to other data sets as they are highest among those scoring 10. All of the top 5 have had 12 or less fires incidents recorded in the data set, meaning they are incredibly safe for habitation from a fire perspective. St. Clair, Arlington Heights, and Oakwood are all incredibly safe as well and should also be included in the final analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "For the police incidents metric we concluded the best neighborhoods are ones like St. Clair, West End, and a few others because they have only had one or two incidents in the past month. These neighborhoods therefor receive the highest possible scores for the police incidents metric. Only 5 neighborhoods for this metric receive the highest possible score of 10 for having less than 2 incidents. This is a remarkably low incident rate indicating the incredible safety of these neighborhoods. We wil consider these 5 candidates first when comparing with the other metrics but if these do not align with what the results from the other metrics indicate we will take examine the 9 rated neighborhoods which also have an incredibly low incident rate, many only have 2 incidents reported. \n",

Those neighborhoods receiving a score of 10 as listed above will be considered first when compared with the other categories but neighborhoods with a score of 9 will also be taken into account as this is still an incredibly low arrest rate indicating a safe neighborhood.\n"

    "Based on all the data from all the neighborhoods the one with the best score would be St. Clair, receiving a 10 in all categories for a combined score of 30, a perfect score. This neighborhood seems to have exceptionally low rates of crime as well as fire events, making it an ideal choice when considering the safest neighborhood in the city. Based on the data anaylzed in all three metrics this would be the **best** neighborhood."

    "Along with St. Clair there are several other neighborhoods which are also exceptionally good, though they do not receive a perfect score in all categories like St. Clair. These are Oakwood, Arlington Heights, and Mount Oliver which all have cumulative scores of 29, also making them strong contenders for the safest neighborhood in Pittsburgh. It may be important to consider other factors in addition to the three we have touched upon in determining the best among these. However, purely based on the overarching metric of safety we have decided on and the results of the 3 individual metrics each of us examined, St. Clair would receive the best overall rating, making it the safest neighborhood according to these conditions.
